We will systematically investigate similarity-based machine learning with structured data such
as strings, trees and graphs. While most off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms require data to be
embedded in a (finite or infinite) dimensional inner product space, most intuitive notions of similarity for
structured data by domain experts do not allow for such an embedding. Examples of such similarities are
based on alignments, edit operations, or (graph) matching. Recent progress has allowed learning
algorithms to use more general similarities which can be embedded in Krein space. While preliminary work
shows the potential of this approach to learning with structured data, this possibility has never been
systematically explored. Furthermore, even these approaches have no means for dealing naturally with
asymmetric notions of similarity like the ones based on substructure relations. This project will close the
described gaps by (_i_) designing and investigating general similarities for structured data, (_ii_) developing
learning algorithms for general similarities, and (_iii_) applying combinations of these for concrete problems in
cheminformatics. Progress in the design of RNA therapeutics, polyketide pharmaceuticals, and the
prediction of mass spectra will have high impact on several areas of human society. Our approach
promises higher predictive performance, more efficient learning, and better interpretability of the models by
domain experts.

Many important questions and grand challenges in research, industry, and society involve large and complex networks of
chemical reactions. Some examples are: studying metabolic networks in humans; planning and optimizing chemical
synthesis in industry and research labs; modeling the fragmentation process in mass spectrometry; developing personalized
medicine; probing hypotheses of the origins of life; monitoring environmental pollution in air, water, and soil.
In project TACsy, we will develop ground-breaking new computational methods for analyzing such networks of chemical
reactions and we will train a new generation of excellent and innovative early stage researchers (ESRs) capable of evolving
and applying these methods in research and industry. Combined, these efforts carry very strong potential for impact on the
grand challenges mentioned above, on the EU commission priority on jobs, growth, investment, and competitiveness, and on
the well-being of EU citizens.
The research methodology of TACsy arises from the novel application of formalisms, algorithms, and computational methods
from computer science to questions in systems chemistry. The first steps demonstrating the strong capabilities of this
approach have recently been made. In TACsy, the ESRs will vastly expand these methods and their formal foundations, they
will create efficient algorithms and implementations of them, and they will use these implementations for research in complex
chemical systems in three flagship application areas.
TACsy is a consortium of world-class, experienced scientists which will ensure excellent research training conditions for the
ESRs in this highly interdisciplinary field. Through a carefully designed training programme and secondments at leading
industry partners, the ESR will acquire a broad career perspective and a strong set of transferable skills. Their unique blend
of competences from computer science and chemistry will further increase their high employability.
