The  {{site.data.links.TUWienML_en}} research unit of {{site.data.links.TUWienInformatics}} is looking to hire, as soon as possible, more machine learning researchers.<br><br>


Vienna has repeatedly been named the <a href="https://www.wien.info/en/lifestyle-scene/most-livable-city">most liveable city</a> in the world and the {{site.data.links.InformaticsTUWien}} has consistently been ranked among the top 100 computer science departments in the world. Our group is strongly connected to the European and international machine learning communities. The head of the research unit, {% include linked_name.html id="ThomasGaertner" %}, is an editor of the Machine Learning journal, was program co-chair of the largest European conference in the field (ECML PKDD'18), and has been area chair for NeurIPS for a number of years among other <a href="{{'/activities' | prepend: site.data.links.Thomas }}">activities</a>.<br><br>


The {{site.data.links.TUWienMLRU_en}} investigates fundamental machine learning questions and demonstrates the applicability of novel algorithms in real-world applications, often together with colleagues and collaborators from other disciplines such as Chemistry. Challenges that we investigate often involve structured data such as graphs, iterative learning processes such as online/active learning, approximation/convergence guarantees, and computational questions such as the parallelisation of machine learning algorithms. For an overview of some of our research interests, please have a look at previous <a href="{{'/papers' | prepend: site.data.links.Thomas }}">publications</a>. You may also check out <a href="/people">current and previous group members</a>.<br><br>

The following position is currently available in the {{site.data.links.TUWienMLRU_en}} :

<ul>
<li> <a href=https://jobs.tuwien.ac.at/Job/227452>open topic PraeDoc position (<b>deadline 7. March 2024</b>)</a></li>
</ul>

<b>In your application, please include:</b>
<ul>
<li>a cover letter stating the your motivation to apply and the reason(s) why you should be selected for the position;</li>
<li>a curriculum vitae including a list of all publications (if any) and <i>transcripts of all marks</i>;</li>
<li>a short research statement (describing possible research questions with motivation, challenges, approach, and pointing out how it connects to the research interests of the group/project);</li>
<li>an example of your research (e.g. a thesis and/or published papers); and</li>
<li>the contact details of two referees.</li>
</ul>

For the <b>open topic position</b>, we are looking for candidates whose research interests overlap with that of the group and have an excellent background in computer science, mathematics, or a related field. Please make sure to clarify the overlap in your research statement. 

A non-exclusive list of possible topics is:

<ul>
<li>Scalable interactive machine learning</li>
<li>Parallel machine learning</li>
<li>Machine learning with structured data, including the prediction of structured objects such as graphs</li>
</ul>
